## Important notes about data used in this project.

**1. This project uses data compiled in XLS files.**

**2. The Stock price data is fetched directly from yfinance, while all the other data is manually compiled.**  
*Example: See [yfinance documentation](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) or refer to `scripts/fetch_stock_data.py` for usage.*

**3. You can set up a data sourcing pipeline separately and store it in this folder. Change in the config/filepath.ini as applicable.**
